# 1. Write a program that uses the file you created in 6 â€“ 2 called
# number_list.txt
# 2. Your program should read in number_list.txt and calculate the sum and
# average of all the numbers and display the sum and the average.
# 3. Additionally, it should:
# a. Handle any IOError exceptions that are raised when the file is opened and
# data is read from it
# b. Handle any ValueError exceptions that are raised when the items read are
# converted to numbers
# c. Handle any other unspecified errors
