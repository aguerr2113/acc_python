# Program 2 â€“ Read numbers from a file:
    # 1. Open the file you just created.
    
    # 2. Read all the numbers from the file and display them.
    # Terminate the loop by detecting end of file with a for loop
    # (the second method we discussed).

# Turn in your two program files to the practice assignment link
# in course content.
